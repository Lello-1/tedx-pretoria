						<h4>Bio</h4>
						<p>Phila Lubisi was born in Kwazulu-Natal, in the small town of Pongola. His parents moved to the neighbouring town, Piet-Retief, before finally settling down in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga. At a young age, he learnt to be very independent when times were tough living in one room with his parents. He started selling sweets at school in order to earn pocket money.</p>
						<p>Growing up in a family run commune, he was always exposed to different personalities. At times, this meant at the expense of personal space. At one point, he was sharing a room with 7 other tenants. This meant he knew the sacrifices that were behind his private school education. </p>
						<p>The University of Pretoria was the place where this tall, slender guy from Witbank would come into his own and find his individuality. Initially rejected by the University, his ambition led him to be in the top 15% academic achievers of 2012 by the Golden Key International Society.</p>
						<p>This inspired greater things. Phila is now a motivational speaker and youth mentor and founder of ""Me,We"" youth mentorship program where he mentors students aged 17-22. From 9-5 he serves as a consultant for a Global Media Intelligence company, Meltwater. </p>
						<p>I often say that I don’t have a 5, 10 or even 20-year plan but I do have a 100-year plan. I wish to serve the world with distinction. I hope future generations of African children will feed off my work and be inspired to live their lives without limits.</p>

						<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called <strong>TEDxPretoria</strong>, where x = independently organized TED event.</p>
						<p>At our <strong>TEDxPretoria</strong> event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>
						<p>This independent TEDx event is operated under license from TED.</p>
