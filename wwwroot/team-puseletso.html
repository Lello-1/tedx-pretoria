						<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called <strong>TEDxPretoria</strong>, where x = independently organized TED event.</p>
						<p>At our <strong>TEDxPretoria</strong> event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>
						<p>This independent TEDx event is operated under license from TED.</p>
